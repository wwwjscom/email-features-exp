  negative boost: body term of 0.3
  positive boost: subject term
  f(r) = r + log(h/t), t = total vol. of email for that mailbox; h = total vol of email for that hour for that mailbox

t6:
  purpose: same as t4, but with day instead of hour
  negative boost: body term of 0.3
  positive boost: subject term
  f(r) = r + log(t/h), t = total vol. of email for that mailbox; h = total vol of email for that day for that mailbox

t7:

t9:
  purpose: opposite of t8
  negative boost: body term of 0.3
  positive boost: subject term
  f(r) = r / l, l = the number of attachments for this email, so long as l > 0

t10:
  purpose: boost emails found in mailboxes that have a high avg number of bytes per email

t11:
  purpose: opposite of t10
  negative boost: body term of 0.3
  positive boost: subject term
  f(r) = r - log(log(b)), b = avg number of bytes per email body for that mailbox

t12:
  purpose: boost emails whose bytes are higher than the avg found for that mailbox
  negative boost: body term of 0.3
  positive boost: subject term
  f(r) = r + (l/b), l = number of bytes in this emails body; b = avg number of bytes per email body for that mailbox

t13:
  purpose: opposite of 12
  negative boost: body term of 0.3
  positive boost: subject term
  f(r) = r - (l/b), l = number of bytes in this emails body; b = avg number of bytes per email body for that mailbox
